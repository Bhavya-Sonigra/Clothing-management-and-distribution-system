## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 User Story

As a fabric store owner managing multiple responsibilities—from inventory control to order processing and payment tracking—I need an efficient system that simplifies my daily operations. Our staff should be able to process sales quickly through an intuitive POS interface, while inventory personnel can easily update stock levels. Store managers need a central dashboard for monitoring operations and generating comprehensive reports. The system must also support customer relationship management and offer the flexibility to handle credit transactions with defined payment periods. This system will streamline our workload and boost efficiency across all levels of our business.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The Clothing Management And Distribution System operates as a standalone application tailored for small to medium fabric retailers. Our solution prioritizes a manual, form-driven approach while incorporating QR code payment methods. The system integrates robust CRM features and works seamlessly with external payment gateways without compromising its straightforward user experience.

### 2.2 Product Functions

The system delivers these core functions:

* **Manual SKU Management:**  
  Users can create, manage, and validate SKUs based on fabric characteristics, with the system automatically generating unique identifiers.

* **Customer Order Processing:**  
  The system facilitates manual order entry, calculates pricing (including taxes and discounts), and finalizes orders efficiently.

* **Payment Processing:**  
  Staff can generate QR codes for digital payments, handle cash transactions with automatic change calculation, verify payment completion, and process refunds. The system also supports credit sales with defined payment periods.

* **Inventory Management:**  
  Users can track stock levels, receive low stock alerts, and perform inventory adjustments and updates.

* **Invoice and Reporting:**  
  The system generates detailed sales invoices, reconciles daily transactions, and provides various operational reports.

* **Returns Processing:**  
  Staff can process customer returns, issue appropriate refunds, and update inventory accordingly.

* **Customer Relationship Management:**  
  Users can manage customer profiles, track purchasing history.

### 2.3 User Characteristics

Our system serves three primary user groups:

* **Sales Staff:**  
  Typically possessing minimal technical expertise, these users require an intuitive interface for rapid and accurate order processing.

* **Inventory Staff:**  
  With moderate technical proficiency, these users need detailed access to managing stock levels and recording inventory transactions.

* **Store Managers:**  
  Responsible for overseeing operations, managers require a comprehensive dashboard displaying key performance indicators, CRM insights, and credit period management.

### 2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints

The system development must account for these constraints:

* **Manual Entry Focus:**  
  The system relies on manual SKU entry with thorough form validation.

* **Payment Methods:**  
  Support is limited to cash and QR code payments, integrating with common digital payment platforms.

* **Security Requirements:**  
  The system must comply with data protection regulations and implement secure transaction storage with role-based access controls.

* **Offline Capability:**  
  Core functions must remain operational during internet outages by queuing QR payments for later processing.

* **Hardware Requirements:**  
  The system must function on standard commercial hardware without specialized equipment.

* **Interface Design:**  
  All interfaces must be touch-screen compatible and responsive across various display sizes.

* **Technology Stack:**  
  Development will use ReactJS (front-end), Spring Boot MVC (back-end), and PostgreSQL (database).

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

Our approach assumes:

* Consistent internet connectivity for payment processing
* Adequate staff training on manual operations
* Established SKU naming conventions and customer data policies

The system depends on external:

* Successful integration with third-party QR payment gateways
* Compliance with local tax regulations
* Compatible hardware availability
